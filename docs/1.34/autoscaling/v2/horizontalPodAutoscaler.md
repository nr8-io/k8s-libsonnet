```

"Time is a wrapper around time.Time which supports correct marshaling to YAML and JSON.  Wrappers are provided for many of the factory methods that the time package offers."

### fn metadata.withDeletionGracePeriodSeconds

```ts
withDeletionGracePeriodSeconds(deletionGracePeriodSeconds)
```

"Number of seconds allowed for this object to gracefully terminate before it will be removed from the system. Only set when deletionTimestamp is also set. May only be shortened. Read-only."

### fn metadata.withDeletionTimestamp

```ts

"Time is a wrapper around time.Time which supports correct marshaling to YAML and JSON.  Wrappers are provided for many of the factory methods that the time package offers."

### fn metadata.withFinalizers

```ts
withFinalizers(finalizers)
```

"Must be empty before the object is deleted from the registry. Each entry is an identifier for the responsible component that will remove the entry from the list. If the deletionTimestamp of the object is non-nil, entries in this list can only be removed. Finalizers may be processed and removed in any order.  Order is NOT enforced because it introduces significant risk of stuck finalizers. finalizers is a shared field, any actor with permission can reorder it. If the finalizer list is processed in order, then this can lead to a situation in which the component responsible for the first finalizer in the list is waiting for a signal (field value, external system, or other) produced by a component responsible for a finalizer later in the list, resulting in a deadlock. Without enforced ordering finalizers are free to order amongst themselves and are not vulnerable to ordering changes in the list."

"GenerateName is an optional prefix, used by the server, to generate a unique name ONLY IF the Name field has not been provided. If this field is used, the name returned to the client will be different than the name passed. This value will also be combined with a unique suffix. The provided value has the same validation rules as the Name field, and may be truncated by the length of the suffix required to make the value unique on the server.\n\nIf this field is specified and the generated name exists, the server will return a 409.\n\nApplied only if Name is not specified.

## obj spec

"HorizontalPodAutoscalerSpec describes the desired functionality of the HorizontalPodAutoscaler."

### fn spec.withMaxReplicas

```ts
withMaxReplicas(maxReplicas)
```

"maxReplicas is the upper limit for the number of replicas to which the autoscaler can scale up. It cannot be less that minReplicas."

### fn spec.withMetrics

```ts
withMetrics(metrics)
```

"metrics contains the specifications for which to use to calculate the desired replica count (the maximum replica count across all metrics will be used).  The desired replica count is calculated multiplying the ratio between the target value and the current value by the current number of pods.  Ergo, metrics used must decrease as the pod count is increased, and vice-versa.  See the individual metric source types for more information about how each type of metric must respond. If not set, the default metric will be set to 80% average CPU utilization."

### fn spec.withMinReplicas

```ts
withMinReplicas(minReplicas)
```

"minReplicas is the lower limit for the number of replicas to which the autoscaler can scale down.  It defaults to 1 pod.  minReplicas is allowed to be 0 if the alpha feature gate HPAScaleToZero is enabled and at least one Object or External metric is configured.  Scaling is active as long as at least one metric value is available."

### fn spec.withScaleTargetRef

```ts
withScaleTargetRef(object)
```

Set spec.ScaleTargetRef to `object`

## obj spec.behavior

"HorizontalPodAutoscalerBehavior configures the scaling behavior of the target in both Up and Down directions (scaleUp and scaleDown fields respectively)."

## obj spec.behavior.scaleDown

"HPAScalingRules configures the scaling behavior for one direction via scaling Policy Rules and a configurable metric tolerance.\n\nScaling Policy Rules are applied after calculating DesiredReplicas from metrics for the HPA. They can limit the scaling velocity by specifying scaling policies. They can prevent flapping by specifying the stabilization window, so that the number of replicas is not set instantly, instead, the safest value from the stabilization window is chosen.\n\nThe tolerance is applied to the metric values and prevents scaling too eagerly for small metric variations. (Note that setting a tolerance requires enabling the alpha HPAConfigurableTolerance feature gate.)"

### fn spec.behavior.scaleDown.withPolicies

```ts
withPolicies(policies)
```

"policies is a list of potential scaling polices which can be used during scaling. If not set, use the default values: - For scale up: allow doubling the number of pods, or an absolute change of 4 pods in a 15s window. - For scale down: allow all pods to be removed in a 15s window."

```

"stabilizationWindowSeconds is the number of seconds for which past recommendations should be considered while scaling up or scaling down.

If not set, use the default values: - For scale up: 0 (i.e. no stabilization is done). - For scale down: 300 (i.e. the stabilization window is 300 seconds long)."

### fn spec.behavior.scaleDown.withTolerance

```ts
