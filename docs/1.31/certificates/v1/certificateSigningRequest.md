# certificates.v1.certificateSigningRequest

"CertificateSigningRequest objects provide a mechanism to obtain x509 certificates by submitting a certificate signing request, and having it asynchronously approved and issued.\n\nKubelets use this API to obtain:\n 1. client certificates to authenticate to kube-apiserver (with the \"kubernetes.io/kube-apiserver-client-kubelet\" signerName).\n 2. serving certificates for TLS endpoints kube-apiserver can connect to securely (with the \"kubernetes.io/kubelet-serving\" signerName).\n\nThis API can be used to request client certificates to authenticate to kube-apiserver (with the \"kubernetes.io/kube-apiserver-client\" signerName), or to obtain certificates from custom non-Kubernetes signers."

## Fields

### fn new

```ts
new(name)
```

new returns an instance of CertificateSigningRequest

## obj metadata

"ObjectMeta is metadata that all persisted resources must have, which includes all objects users must create."

### fn metadata.withAnnotations

```ts
withAnnotations(annotations)
```

"Annotations is an unstructured key value map stored with a resource that may be set by external tools to store and retrieve arbitrary metadata. They are not queryable and should be preserved when modifying objects. More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/annotations"

### fn metadata.withAnnotationsMixin

```ts
withAnnotationsMixin(annotations)
```

"Annotations is an unstructured key value map stored with a resource that may be set by external tools to store and retrieve arbitrary metadata. They are not queryable and should be preserved when modifying objects. More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/annotations"

**Note:** This function appends passed data to existing values

### fn metadata.withCreationTimestamp

```ts
withCreationTimestamp(creationTimestamp)
```

"Time is a wrapper around time.Time which supports correct marshaling to YAML and JSON.  Wrappers are provided for many of the factory methods that the time package offers."

### fn metadata.withDeletionGracePeriodSeconds

```ts
withDeletionGracePeriodSeconds(deletionGracePeriodSeconds)
```

"Number of seconds allowed for this object to gracefully terminate before it will be removed from the system. Only set when deletionTimestamp is also set. May only be shortened. Read-only."

### fn metadata.withDeletionTimestamp

```ts
withDeletionTimestamp(deletionTimestamp)
```

"Time is a wrapper around time.Time which supports correct marshaling to YAML and JSON.  Wrappers are provided for many of the factory methods that the time package offers."

### fn metadata.withFinalizers

```ts
withFinalizers(finalizers)
```

"Must be empty before the object is deleted from the registry. Each entry is an identifier for the responsible component that will remove the entry from the list. If the deletionTimestamp of the object is non-nil, entries in this list can only be removed. Finalizers may be processed and removed in any order.  Order is NOT enforced because it introduces significant risk of stuck finalizers. finalizers is a shared field, any actor with permission can reorder it. If the finalizer list is processed in order, then this can lead to a situation in which the component responsible for the first finalizer in the list is waiting for a signal (field value, external system, or other) produced by a component responsible for a finalizer later in the list, resulting in a deadlock. Without enforced ordering finalizers are free to order amongst themselves and are not vulnerable to ordering changes in the list."

### fn metadata.withFinalizersMixin

withFinalizersMixin(finalizers)
```

"Must be empty before the object is deleted from the registry. Each entry is an identifier for the responsible component that will remove the entry from the list.

"GenerateName is an optional prefix, used by the server, to generate a unique name ONLY IF the Name field has not been provided. If this field is used, the name returned to the client will be different than the name passed. This value will also be combined with a unique suffix. The provided value has the same validation rules as the Name field, and may be truncated by the length of the suffix required to make the value unique on the server.\n\nIf this field is specified and the generated name exists, the server will return a 409.\n\nApplied only if Name is not specified.

A workflow can be the user's name, a controller's name, or the name of a specific apply path like \"ci-cd\". The set of fields is always in the version that the workflow used when modifying the object."

### fn metadata.withManagedFieldsMixin

```ts
withManagedFieldsMixin(managedFields)
```

"ManagedFields maps workflow-id and version to the set of fields that are managed by that workflow. This is mostly for internal housekeeping, and users typically shouldn't need to set or understand this field.

### fn metadata.withOwnerReferencesMixin

```ts
withOwnerReferencesMixin(ownerReferences)
```

"List of objects depended by this object. If ALL objects in the list have been deleted, this object will be garbage collected.

### fn metadata.withResourceVersion

```ts

## obj spec

"CertificateSigningRequestSpec contains the certificate request."

### fn spec.withExpirationSeconds

```ts
withExpirationSeconds(expirationSeconds)
```

"expirationSeconds is the requested duration of validity of the issued certificate. The certificate signer may issue a certificate with a different validity duration so a client must check the delta between the notBefore and and notAfter fields in the issued certificate to determine the actual duration.\n\nThe v1.22+ in-tree implementations of the well-known Kubernetes signers will honor this field as long as the requested duration is not greater than the maximum duration they will honor per the --cluster-signing-duration CLI flag to the Kubernetes controller manager.\n\nCertificate signers may not honor this field for various reasons:\n\n  1. Old signer that is unaware of the field (such as the in-tree\n     implementations prior to v1.22)\n  2. Signer whose configured maximum is shorter than the requested duration\n  3. Signer whose configured minimum is longer than the requested duration\n\nThe minimum valid value for expirationSeconds is 600, i.e. 10 minutes."
